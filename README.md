##  Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the IBY-Chat-Assignment. This repository contains the frontend of the chat application written in ReactJS. It utilizes various components from the Bootstrap library for building the user interface and has integrated icons from the Font Awesome library to enhance the visual experience. I have implemented axios for making fetch requests to the backend. 





## Features

- Bootstrap Components : The project leverages a variety of Bootstrap components to create a sleek and responsive user interface, ensuring a consistent and visually pleasing design.

- Font Awesome Icons : To enhance the visual appeal and user experience, several icons have been incorporated from the Font Awesome library.
